This is my second attempt at a personal homepage. It contains both my blog and my portfolio.  
The page most likely doesn't work correctly in old browsers (looking at you, IE11), but I won't fix this.


## How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:LenaSchnedlitz/personal-homepage.git
cd personal-homepage
npm install
npm run dev
```

Refer to the official [Sapper documentation](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs) for more details.

### Tests

You need [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to execute tests.

```bash
npm test
```
