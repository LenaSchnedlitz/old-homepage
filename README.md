This is my second attempt at a personal homepage. It contains both my blog and my portfolio.  
The page most likely doesn't work correctly in old browsers (looking at you, IE11), but I won't fix this.


## How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LenaSchnedlitz/LenaSchnedlitz.github.io.git
cd LenaSchnedlitz.github.io.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

Refer to the official [Svelte-Kit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) for more details.
