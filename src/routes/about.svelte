  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    My name is <mark>Lena Schnedlitz</mark> and Iâ€™m a <em>software engineer</em>
    from Vienna, Austria.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy implementing and optimizing things. You can find most of my stuff on
    <a class="link" href="https://github.com/LenaSchnedlitz">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is about my personal projects and opinions. There might be a slight bias towards
    content related to programming, but I also post about topics like math puzzles,
    origami, and video games.
