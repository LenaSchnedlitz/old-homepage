In my opinion, Skyrim is one of the best games ever made.
As a completionist, I spent ages trying to unlock all perks.
However, at higher levels, it gets difficult to plan ahead and figure out 
how much training will be needed to reach a long-yearned-for level up.
Thatâ€™s why I decided to make a tool for character progress optimization.

SkyCalc uses level information to predict how much training of user-selected skills is needed to 
reach a certain goal level. 
The tool also offers guidance which skills to choose for role-playing.
Results can be exported as a text file.
