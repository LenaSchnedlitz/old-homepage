&shy;<a href="https://www.luups.net/">LUUPS</a> is a city guide with vouchers that is
published annually. I've been using the booklet for some years now and can strongly recommend
it, but it lacks one important feature: <em>an interactive, filterable map</em>.

I teamed up with another Viennese software engineer, <a href="https://github.com/hschne">Hans&nbsp;Schnedlitz</a> (the name is no coincidence),
to develop exactly this.

Our tool consists of a map with a marker for each voucher location. Clicking on a marker reveals
additional details about the location, e.g. homepage and opening hours. Locations can also be filtered
by voucher type and/or tag.

*Note:* A year after the development of LUUPS Map, LUUPS added an official map to their homepage. As a result,
this project will not be updated any more.
